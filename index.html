			Modernizer is a javascript library, 
		used to load in all of the JS files the game needs.
			Modernizer also makes easier the checking for browser features.
			With Modernizer, one can trigger functions to run 
		immediately after a script is loaded 
		rather than waiting until the entire page, 
		including HGML, and images, has loaded.
			Modernizer enables "conditional loads" of files.
			Modernizer actually uses another library called yepnope.js 
		for its script-loading functionality. (see http://yepnopejs.com/).
			In downloading Modernizer, features are individually enabled or not.
		to minimize the code. The following features were selected for this game:
				CSS Transitions (under CSS3)
				Canvas and HTML5 Audio (under HTML5)
				Modernizr.load (under Extra)
				Modernizr.prefixed (under Extensibility)

				below, "$(function(){...." 
				represents shorthand for the JQuery function where a function is also passed in,
				which jQuery stores to run once th DOM is ready to be manipulated. READ BELOW for
				explanation of case where a string is passed in (jQuery intreprets as "selector")

				So below, the jQuery function is allowed to begin after game.js completes loading.
				So, code for the game can begin to run without waiting for other game assets, 
				such as images and sounds, to finish loading. Browsers, and versions of each browser,
				vary in how one determines that the DOM is ready, 
				and jQuery smoothes over any browser inconsistencies.

				here, first an instance of the Game "class" is created by "var game =..",
				and then, the public init() method is called. anything done inside "init"
				will not happen until after jQuery has loaded and the DOM is ready to be 
				worked upon.

				this method of creating the var "game", an instance of the Game "class",
				provides "closure".  the "game" instance lives on, along with the variables 
				and methods defined within it. the outside world can still use these methods 
				to operate on the instance and fetch data from within it.  

				SELECTOR examples for jQuery function:
				js code for selecting DOM node (here selecting our "game" div element) with an ID:
					var element = document.getElementById("game");
				now
				  element.getAttribute("id") will return the string, "game"
				same thing using jQuery selector:
					$("#game").attr("id");
				explained:
					Nearly all of jQuery is used to manipulate DOM elements.
					Exact jQuery equivalent of 'var element = document.getElementById("game");' is
						var element = jQuery("game").get(0);
					The get(0) function call retrieves the DOM object from within the jQuery object.
					"(0)" represents the first item in the jQuery object.
					Shorter version is
						var element = $("#game").get(0);  //$ represents the jQuery function
					the "#" specifies an ID element, just as with CSS.
				 	$("game") returns the jQuery objec containing a reference to the DOM node.
				 	
				 	A main advantage is that jQuery returns objects with cross-browser metods 
				 	that abstract away a lot of the hard work of DOM manipulation.
				 	jQuery objects let us query the DOM for various CSS properties, such as :
				 		var top = $("game").css("top");  //fetches div's top position
				 		var width = $("game").width();	 //fetches width
				 		var divs = $("div");  //returns jQuery object containing all div tags on page
				 	reference for more: http://api.jquery.com/

				$(function(){
					var game = new BubbleShoot.Game();
					//MyCanvas :  inside game.init,
					//must wait for sprite sheet image to load
					//before performing the init() actions

				})

		/* note all file paths based on one main game folder, (call it BubbleShooter for instance).

		UI functions are contained in the ui.js file.
		UI functions just determine the appearance of game objects and displays. 
		UI functions dont change game state.
